## Project: Represent a dataset (of your choice) pictorially
## Details: 
- Represent a dataset (of your choice) pictorially using any data visualization library in the programming language of your choice. 
- Create a line graph, bar chart, histogram, heatmaps. 
- Upload the code to a GitHub repository and share it with us on our Devpost.

## Dataset:
  - Covid-19 2021 global cases dataset, taken from WHO (World Health Organization). The download link is shared below;
  - https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv

## Programming Language:
  - Python

## Visualization Libraries:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Other Libraries:
  - Pandas

## Environment:
  - Google Colaboratory, access link below
  - https://colab.research.google.com/ 
  
## How and What I did:
  - First of all, I pre-processed the data. I selected the data that I wanted to visualize (Countries and New_cases) and grouped the selected data country vise.
  - The data is from **2020-01-03** until **2023-02-10**, if someone wants to use this code, note that your visualizations may show updated according to the dataset selected.
  - Then I used matplotlib and seaborn to show line graph, bar chart, histogram and heatmap respectively. The visualizations are shown below;
